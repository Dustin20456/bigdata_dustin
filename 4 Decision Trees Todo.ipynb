    "A decision tree would calculate a quality function based on each split of the data, and it does this for each feature in every node that is not a leaf node. This happens as long as there are levels (depth) to continue to. In the best case of a balanced tree the depth would be in  O(logN) , but the decision tree does locally optimal splits without caring much about balancing. This means that the worst case of depth being in  O(N)  is possible - basically when each split simply splits data in 1 and n-1 examples, where n is the number of examples of the current node.\n",
